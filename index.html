    <h1 id="title">Liveability in Australia</h1>
    <div>
      <p id="p1">
        As populations of metropolitan cities increase rapidly, living
        conditions within those cities are more important than ever. Liveability
        describes the frame conditions of a decent life for all citizens of the
        city. The Economic Intelligence Unit (EIU) creates a Global Liveability
        Index examines 140 cities worldwide and creates a ranking of their
        liveability, by the Liveability Index. Australian cities consistently
        rank as some of the most liveable cities. In particular Melbourne was
        awarded the world’s most liveable city for the seventh reoccurring year
        in 2017. What impacts this, and how is liveability in Australian
        capitals?

    <h2 id="T2">What positively impacts liveability?</h2>
    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-3">
        <p id="p2">
          The EIU considers many factors in their ranking. These factors are
          culture, education, health care, infrastructure, and stability. In a
          survey done by the City of Melbourne, it was found that citizens of
          the city greatly value health care and infrastructure, similar to the
          EIU.

    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-3">
        <p id="p3">
          Many factors also decrease liveability. According to the same survey,
          residents of Melbourne expressed that factors that decrease the
          liveability is the high cost of living, lack of safety, pollution, and
          weather. Notably, cost of living and lack of safety are significantly
          more important than pollution and weather.

    <h2>Effect of the pandemic on liveability</h2>
    <div class="pure-g">

        <p>
          Obviously, the pandemic has created a huge shift in living standards
          and situations. There was a significant drop off in the Liveability
          Index of Australian capitals as a result, with larger cities being
          affected more.

    <h2>Top suburbs in Melbourne</h2>
    <div class="pure-g">
      <div class="pure-u-1-3">
        <p>
          Even with the pandemic, Melbourne suburbs are still amongst some of
          the best places to live. PwC’s CityPulse ranks Melbourne suburbs by a
          City Pulse Score, from 0 to 10, measuring the living conditions. As
          seen, the eastern suburbs rank extremely high.
